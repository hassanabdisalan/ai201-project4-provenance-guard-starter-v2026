# ─── The service ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# `127.0.0.1` is loopback — only your own machine can reach it, which is what
# you want all through units 7 and 8. A host somewhere else has to accept
# traffic from outside the box, and that means `0.0.0.0`. Setting the env var
# is how you get it; the default keeps your local `curl` commands unchanged.
HOST = os.getenv("HOST", "127.0.0.1")
PORT = int(os.getenv("PORT", "5000"))

# Flask's debug mode gives anyone who can reach the service an interactive
# Python prompt inside your process. Fine on loopback, a gift to strangers
# anywhere else — so it turns itself off the moment HOST isn't loopback.

# ─── The local model ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Your first signal runs a language model ON YOUR OWN MACHINE. No account, no
# key, no card. It downloads about 550 MB the first time — do that before
# class, not during it.
#
# What it measures: how *predictable* your text is to a language model. Text a
# model finds easy to predict tends to be text a model wrote.
#
# The first call is the slow one — ten to twenty seconds while the model loads,
# longer on an older laptop. After that it stays in memory and a submission
# takes a second or two. That cost is part of what you're learning: this is
# what running a model inline in a request actually looks like.

DETECTOR_MODEL = os.getenv("AI201_DETECTOR_MODEL", "gpt2")

# Longer text gives a steadier reading but takes longer. 400 tokens is roughly
# 300 words, which is enough for the signal to mean something.

# decision) rather than silently truncated.

# ─── Scoring (Milestone 4) ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
# How much each signal counts toward the combined score.
#
# Three signals (stretch): phrasing.py::phrase_signal is a third, optional
# signal layered on top of the required two. It's the easiest of the three to
# defeat on purpose (see phrasing.py's blind-spot note), so it carries the
# smallest weight — it nudges the score, it doesn't drive it.

# ─── Thresholds (Milestone 5) ────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Where one label becomes another. Scores run 0.0 (confidently human) to 1.0
# (confidently AI).
#
#   score < HUMAN_THRESHOLD          -> high-confidence human
#   between the two                  -> unsure
#   score > AI_THRESHOLD             -> high-confidence AI
#
# ⚠️ This is where your false-positive decision from Milestone 1 actually gets
# made. Widening the unsure band means fewer wrong accusations and more AI text
# getting through. There is no setting that avoids the trade — only settings
# that decide who pays for it.

HUMAN_THRESHOLD = 0.35
AI_THRESHOLD = 0.65

# ⚠️ One thing that catches people out in Milestone 5. A weighted average can
# only land between its two inputs — so while `style_signal` is still the stub
# returning 0.5, the combined score can never leave 0.25–0.75 no matter what
# the model signal says, and the human label needs a model score below 0.20 to
# be reachable at all.
#
# If a label you can't reach is the problem, the fix is upstream of the
# thresholds: a style signal that actually varies. `scoring.label_ranges()`
# prints the bands; the reachable range is a different question.


# ─── Verified-human path (stretch) ───────────────────────────────────────────
# A writer who types this phrase back exactly, via POST /verify, gets a
# "verified" credential attached to their creator_id — not proof they didn't
# use AI, just an honor-code attestation that shows up on their submissions.
# A shared phrase is a weak credential (anyone can read it here and claim it
# for any creator_id); it's a stretch demo of the mechanism, not a real
# identity check.

# ─── Rate limiting (UNIT 8) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Off in unit 7. You turn it on and choose the numbers in unit 8, Milestone 1.

# Think about two people: a real writer submitting their own work a few times
# an hour, and a script sending a thousand variations to map your thresholds.
# Your README has to say why your numbers and not others.
